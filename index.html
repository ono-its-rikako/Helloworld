        <h1>Filler Text!</h1>
        <p>That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</p>
        <p>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Ow, my spirit! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!</p>
        <p>Large bet on myself in round one. The alien mothership is in orbit here. <strong> If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards.</strong> <em> Checkmate.</em> I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.</p>
        <p>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</p>
        <p>Hey, guess what you're accessories to. She also liked to shut up! Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</p>
        <ol>
        <li>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</li><li>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</li><li>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Look, last night was a mistake. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. A true inspiration for the children.</p>
        <p>Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</li><li>Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</li><li>It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! I never loved you. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</p>
        <p>And then the battle's not so bad? There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</p>
        <p>I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.</p>
        <p>But existing is basically all I do! Hey, whatcha watching? She also liked to shut up! It doesn't look so shiny to me. Can we have Bender Burgers again?</p>
        <p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. No! Don't jump! And until then, I can never die?</p>
        <p>How much did you make me? Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</p>
        <p>Negative, bossy meat creature! Anyone who laughs is a communist! Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</p>
        <p>I'm a thing. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Do a flip! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.</p>
        <p>Large bet on myself in round one. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</p>
        <p>I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? No argument here. And I'm his friend Jesus. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p>
        <p>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
