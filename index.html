            <p>You mean it controls your actions? What!? I find your lack of faith disturbing. Look, I can take you as
                far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I want to come
                with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a
                Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
            <p>You mean it controls your actions? You don't believe in the Force, do you? Escape is not his plan. I must
                face him, alone. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of
                thing.</p>

                Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. <strong> You don't believe in the Force, do you?</strong>
                <em> I care.</em> So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>
            <p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. What!? You
                mean it controls your actions? What!? I call it luck. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see!
                How am I supposed to fight?</p>
            <p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. I suggest you try it again, Luke.
                This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Ye-ha! I find your lack of faith disturbing.
            </p>

                <li>Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it?
                Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. What good is a

            <p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're
                going. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</li>

            </ul>

            <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? I need your
                help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I don't know what you're
                talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>

            <p>What!? What?! She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them,
                and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! All right. Well, take care
                of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
            <p>What?! I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of
                the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor!
                Take her away!</p>

            <p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Obi-Wan is
                here. The Force is with him. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial
                Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
            <p>As you wish. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to
                be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've
                seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful
                Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot
                of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
            <p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. All
                right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Kid, I've flown
